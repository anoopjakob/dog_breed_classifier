# dog_breed_classifier
Image classifier using Machine Learning to classify dog breeds

This project compares the perfomance of three pre-trained models or Architecture resnet, vgg , alexnet to find out which one is the best in classifying dog breeds.

Here we are not trying to train a model rather find out how to use a pretrained model.
