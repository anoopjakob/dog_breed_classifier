# dog_breed_classifier
Image classifier using Machine Learning to classify dog breeds

This project compares the perfomance of three pre-trained models or Architecture resnet, vgg , alexnet to find out which one is the best in classifying dog breeds.



## Run Instructions

run the check_images.py --arch <arch> for finding the results of 3 architectures
run 'sh run_models_batch.sh' to pipe data form 3 archs to a text file
similarly run 'sh run_models_batch_uploaded.sh' for uploaded images of your choice.
